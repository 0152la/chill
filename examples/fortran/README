// Manu

1) Fortran support added to permute, tile, unroll and datacopy. Tested these w.r.t gemm.c using gemm.script. 
   There might be other issues (like fusion due to unroll, ...) that have not been tested.

2) To incorporate Fortran support I had to modify certain values in omega (include/omega/omega_core/oc.h). 
   To solve for large number of unknowns, these values have to be reverted back.

3) Tested the existing chill scripts using Derick's python script. 
   At least the existing chill scripts are not affected by the fortran related changes.
