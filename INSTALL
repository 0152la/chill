BUILD
=====

1. Edit Makefile. Change SUIFHOME and OMEGAHOME to correct paths.

2. Do "make depend" in the chill directory.

3. Optional, do "make clean" or "make veryclean" which removes additional
   target files and flex/bison generated files.

4. Do "make".


INSTALLATION
============

You can use CHiLL in source directory since all links are already
created in bin/, lib/ and include/ directories.
